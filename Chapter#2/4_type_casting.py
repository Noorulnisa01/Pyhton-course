# Type casting

x = 10
y = 20
z = 30

# type function is used to show the data type/class of a variable's data.

print(type(x)) # class 'int' means class of x value is integer.
print(type(y)) # class 'int' means class of y value is integer.
print(type(z)) # class 'int' means class of z value is integer.


# Casting means converting one data type to another data type.

a = float(x) # converting integer to float.
b = int(y)   # converting integer to float.

print(type(a)) # class 'float' means class of a value is float.
print(type(b)) # class 'int' means class of b value is integer.

# we can convert the data type of a variable to another data type by using "type casting" function.

c = str(x)
d = str(y)
e = str(z)

print(type(c)) # class 'str' means class of c value is string.
print(type(d)) # class 'str' means class of d value is string.
print(type(e)) # class 'str' means class of e value is string.
