# ***Data Types:***
- ***Data types*** are used to *define the type of data* that a variable can hold.

## ***Categories of data types in python:***
 There are ***six*** data types in python:

[1. integer](#1-int)\
[2. float](#2-float)\
[3. string](#3-string)\
[4. double](#4-double)\
[5. boolean](#5-boolean)\
[6. complex](#6-complex)

# ***1. int:***
- **int** stand for ***integer***.
- A variable that contains **integer/whole** value (....,-3,-2,-1,0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

```python
int a = 10         
```

# ***2. float:***
- float means that ***decimal value***.
- A variable that contains decimal value (....,-3.5,-2.5,-1.5,0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, ...)

```python
float b = 10.5      
```

> #  ***3. string:***
- **str** stand for ***string***.
- A String variable that contains Alphabets/words value (....,"Noor","Ali","Ahmed", ...)

```python
str c = "Noor"

# a variable that contains Alphabets/words value (....,"Noor","Ali","Ahmed", ...)
```

> # ***4. double:***
- **double** means that ***long decimal value***.
- A variable that contains *long decimal value* (....,-3.859646,-2.859646,-1.859646,0.859646, 1.859646, 2.859646, 3.859646, ...)

```python
double d = 10.5247   

# a variable that contains long decimal value (2.859646, 54.21574, 7.69843, etc.)
```
> # ***5. boolean:***
- **bool** stand for ***boolean***.
- A variable that contains ***logical value (True, False).***

```python
bool e = True 

# a variable that contains True or False value (True, False)
```

> # ***6. complex:***
- **complex** stand for ***complex number***.
- A ***complex number*** comprises ***a real part and an imaginary part***, denoted as **a + bi**, where a is the real part, b is the imaginary part, and i is the imaginary unit.

```python
complex f = 10+5j 

# a variable that contains real part and imaginary part (10+5j, 10-5j, 5j, -5j, etc.)
```



# 💡 Did you Think?
> ## ***📝 Question # 1:*** 
### ***who to know the type/class of your data ?***

> ## ***📢 Answer:***

-  By using ***"type"*** function
-  ***"Type"*** word is used to show the type/class of data that stored in a variable.

```python
print(type(x)) 

# class 'int' means class of x value is integer.

print(type(y))

# class 'str' means class of y value is string.
```
