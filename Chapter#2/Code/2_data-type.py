                            # Types/class of data
    # Question: who to know the type/class of your data ?

    # Answer: By using "type" function
    # "Type" word is used to show the type/class of data that stored in a variable.

print(type(x)) # class 'int' means class of x value is integer.
print(type(y)) # class 'str' means class of y value is string.

# There are five data types in python:
# 1. int 
int a = 10          # a variable that contains integer/whole value (....,-3,-2,-1,0, 1, 2, 3, ...)

# 2. float

float b = 10.5      # a variable that contains decimal value (....,-3.5,-2.5,-1.5,0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, ...)

#  3. string
str c = "Noor"      # a variable that contains Alphabets/words value (....,"Noor","Ali","Ahmed", ...)

# 4. double
double d = 10.5     # a variable that contains long decimal value (2.859646, 54.21574, 7.69843, etc.)

# 5. boolean
bool e = True       # a variable that contains True or False value (True, False)

# 6. complex
complex f = 10+5j   # a variable that contains integer,alphabets and operators value (10+5j, 10-5j, 5j, -5j, etc.)

# 7. list
list g = [1,2,3,4]  # List mean a variable that contains data in brackets ([1,2,3,4], [10,20,30,40], etc.
