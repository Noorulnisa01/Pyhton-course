# ***Types of Modules in Python***

> # ***Built-in Modules:***
 - ***Built-in modules*** are ***standard modules*** that are already installed in our program.
 - For example, the math module is a built-in module in Python.



# ***What are External Modules?***
> - ***External modules*** are ***collections of pre-written code*** that offer additional functions, classes, or methods not available in Python’s standard library. These modules usually cater to specific needs like web scraping, data analysis, or machine learning. 
- ***Python’s package manager***, “pip”, makes it exceedingly simple to install and manage these modules.

> # ***Advantages of Using External Modules***
- ***Reusability:*** External modules can be reused in different programs.
- ***Efficiency:*** Instead of writing code from scratch, you can leverage pre-built functionalities.
- ***Flexibility:*** External modules can be modified and customized based on the specific needs of the program.


> # ***List of Most Popular Python External Modules***

Below are just a few of the most popular external modules available in the vast collection of Python packages.
Depending on the domain and specific needs, there are countless other valuable packages available to Python developers.

> # ***1. Web Development:***

- ***Django:*** A high-level web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- ***Flask:***  A lightweight and flexible micro web framework.

> ## ***2. Data Analysis and Manipulation:***

- ***pandas:*** Provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
- ***numpy:*** Fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.
  

3. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:

- ***scikit-learn:*** Machine learning library featuring various algorithms and tools.
- ***TensorFlow:*** Open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.
- ***PyTorch:*** An open-source deep learning platform by Facebook.
> ## ***4. Data Visualization:***

- ***matplotlib:*** Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- ***seaborn:*** Data visualization library based on matplotlib; provides a higher-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
  
> ## ***5. Web Scraping:***

- ***BeautifulSoup:*** Library for pulling data out of HTML and XML documents.
- ***Scrapy:*** An open-source and collaborative web crawling framework.
- 
> ## ***6. Networking and APIs:***

- ***requests:*** Simplifies making HTTP requests.
- ***socket:*** Low-level networking interface.
> ## ***7. Databases:***

- ***SQLAlchemy:*** SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
- ***sqlite3:*** Interface for SQLite databases.
> ## ***8. Testing:***

- ***pytest:*** A robust framework for writing and executing tests.
- ***unittest:*** (Part of the standard library) Unit testing framework.

> ## ***9. GUI Development:***

- ***tkinter:*** Standard GUI library for Python.
- ***PyQt:*** Set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework.

> ## ***10. Scientific Computing:***

- ***SciPy:*** Library used for high-level computations.
- ***SymPy:*** Python library for symbolic mathematics.
  
> ## ***11. Natural Language Processing:***

- ***NLTK:*** Natural language toolkit for Python.
